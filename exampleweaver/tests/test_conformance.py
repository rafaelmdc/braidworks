"""Conformance tests for exampleweaver — the weaver must match its spec.

This wires up weaverkit's WeaverConformanceTests, which checks the manifest,
reachability, and fingerprints, and runs the spec's golden examples (skipping when
the backend is not configured). Do not weaken these — they are the contract.
